Project Req

1. TSX and Components:

    Application is organized into modular components (e.g., PokemonList, PokemonDetails, FavoritePokemonList, PokemonThumbnail)
    Using TSX syntax for rendering UI elements

2. Hooks, State, and Props:

    Implemented functional components that use props to pass data (e.g., FavoritePokemonList receives favorites and onAddFavorite as props).
    State is used to manage dynamic data within application (e.g., useState in PokemonDetails to manage pokemonDetails and loading states).
    Hooks like useState and useEffect are appropriately integrated.

3. Forms and Events:

    Forms are implemented to capture user input (e.g., the form in PokemonDetails component).
    Form submission events are handled (e.g., handleSubmit function in PokemonDetails).
    There is validation and management of form data using React state (e.g., checking if newPokemonName is not empty before making an API call).

4. React Router:

    React Router is utilized for navigation within application (e.g., the use of Link components and the Router component in App).
    Multiple routes to different components/pages are set up (e.g., routes for "/pokemon/:name", "/favorites", and "/" in App).
